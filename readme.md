#DATAMODEL
-datamodel.xml: represents the CloudShell Standard. Avoid modifying the datamodel.xml file as it represents definitions that are a part of the CloudShell standard relevant to the Shell type. It is helpful, however, to review this file in order to understand how it is structured and the type of data it presents.
-shell_model.xml: represents the modeling definitions of your specific Shell and is where weâ€™ll make most of the changes.
